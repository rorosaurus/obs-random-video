# OBS Random Video Player

Play videos in random order!
Perfect for BRB screens!

Modified by rorosaurus to:

* loop a randomly selected video until
* the next random video starts every 3 minutes
* with fade in/out to black transitions in-between each new video

## Instructions

1. Copy the `index.html` file or its code
2. Edit the `videosFolder` to point to the folder of videos you want
3. Add all the videos from that folder to the `videosList`

## Notes

* Set `Refresh browser when scene becomes active` to randomize on each load
* You can only test this in OBS. Normal desktop chrome won't autoplay videos
